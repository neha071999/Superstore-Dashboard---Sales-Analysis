# Superstore-Dashboard---Sales-Analysis
A Superstore Dashboard in Power BI spanning 2014-2017ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¼! I've analyzed years of sales data to uncover trends, KPIs, and insights that can drive smarter business decisions. From profit margins to regional performance, this dashboard offers a comprehensive view of Superstore's journey. This Dashboard contains:

## 1. Data Collection and Preparation:
- Acquire the Superstore dataset for the years 2014 to 2017.
- Clean and prepare the data for analysis. This involves handling missing data, data transformation, and potentially creating new calculated columns through Power Query Editor.
## 2. Data Model:
- In Power BI, create a data model that includes the tables, relationships, and measures necessary for your analysis. Common tables could include Superstore, Superstore 2, Categories, and Shipment.
## 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Define the KPIs you want to measure on your dashboard, such as total sales, profit, order count, average sales and profit, profit percentage, and so on.
## 4. Time Intelligence:
- Implement time intelligence functions to enable easy filtering by year, quarter, month, and day. This will allow users to analyze data over time.
## 5. Visualizations:
Create visualizations like charts, tables, and graphs to represent your data effectively. Some common visualizations to consider include:
- Line charts to show profit trends over the years.
- Bar charts to compare sales by region.
- Maps to visualize geographical data.
- KPI cards to display key metrics.
- Tables to show detailed data and trends.
## 6. Slicers and Filters:
- Add slicers and filters to allow users to interact with the data. For example, users should be able to select specific years, regions, and categories to focus on.
## 7. Custom Calculations:
- Utilize DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom calculations and measures to derive insights beyond what the raw data offers.
## 8. Dashboard Navigation:
- Organize your visualizations into different pages or sections to make navigation intuitive. Users should be able to find what they need easily.
## 9. Deployment:
- Publish your Power BI dashboard to the Power BI Service or your organization's preferred platform for sharing with users.
